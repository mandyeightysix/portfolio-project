            Why do Americans have so many different types of towels? We have
            beach towels, hand towels, bath towels, dish towels, camping towels,
            quick-dry towels, and let’s not forget paper towels. Would 1 type of
            towel work for each of these things? Let’s take a beach towel. It
            can be used to dry your hands and body with no difficulty. A beach
            towel could be used to dry dishes. Just think how many dishes you
            could dry with one beach towel. I’ve used a beach towel with no
            adverse effects while camping. If you buy a thin beach towel it can
            dry quickly too. I’d probably cut up a beach towel to wipe down
            counters or for cleaning other items, but a full beach towel could
            be used too. Is having so many types of towels an extravagant luxury
            that Americans enjoy or is it necessary? I’d say it's overkill and
            we could cut down on the many types of towels that manufacturers
            deem necessary.
